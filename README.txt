Git Release Notes
=================

This is a Git port of the cvs-release-notes PHP script. The original script lives in the Drupal.org CVS repository at http://drupalcode.org/viewvc/drupal/contributions/tricks/cvs-release-notes/ .
The Git version will do the same thing, but use Git. For more information, see http://drupal.org/node/1002410 .
If you have any requests or bug reports, please go to http://drupal.org/node/1002410 and add a comment. In the GitHub issue queue, your issue will most likely go unnoticed.

This script is now a Drush extension, so you must place the file 'grn.drush.inc' in ~/.drush . For more information about installing Drush commands, see the Drush documentation at http://drush.ws .
